The anagram method is a technique that helps to determine if two words have similar combinations of letters. It outputs a boolean value (either True or False) based on the similarity of the words. The logic behind this method is as follows:

1. Convert both words to either uppercase or lowercase.
2. Convert the strings to Arrays
3. Apply a sorting function to the integer values.
4. Compare the sorted integer values of both words. If they are equal, the words are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.

This method is useful for applications such as spelling checkers and word games, where it is necessary to quickly determine if two words are anagrams.
